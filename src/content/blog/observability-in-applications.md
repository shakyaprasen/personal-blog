// Background of what I did in a distributed system

// What is a distributed system
// What is the observability system

// Components in a observable system: (Three pillars of observability)
// - logs
// - metrics
// - traces

// Benefits of observability

// Tools and technology for Observability

// - Log Management through - Elasticsearch, Splunk, etc
// - Gather and Visualize metrics through Prometheus, Grafana, etc.
// - Distributed tracing through Jaeger, Zipkin, Opentelemetry, etc.

// Third party observability platforms like Logz.io, Honeycomb, Datadog, etc. provide
