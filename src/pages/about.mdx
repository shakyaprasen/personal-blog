           I am a software engineer trying to solve actual problems instead of over-engineering solutions to non-existing ones. 
           With over 5+ years of experience with working on both enterprise level software and freelance projects I have helped various teams by contributing through code, documentation as well as visualising problems and their solutions. 
           Looking for any interesting opportunities.
